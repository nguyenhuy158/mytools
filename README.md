Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Previewing the Production Build

```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

```

To deploy a preview URL:

```

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```sh
npx wrangler versions deploy
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
